ABSTRACT

Remarkable progress has been made on automated problem solving through so-
cieties of agents based on large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based
multi-agent systems can already solve simple dialogue tasks. Solutions to more
complex tasks, however, are complicated through logic inconsistencies due to
cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs. Here we introduce
MetaGPT, an innovative meta-programming framework incorporating efficient
human workflows into LLM-based multi-agent collaborations. MetaGPT en-
codes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more
streamlined workflows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise
to verify intermediate results and reduce errors. MetaGPT utilizes an assembly
line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down
complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together. On col-
laborative software engineering benchmarks, MetaGPT generates more coherent
solutions than previous chat-based multi-agent systems. Our project can be found

INTRODUCTION

Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to en-
hance and replicate human workflows. In real-world applications, however, existing systems (Park
et al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023;
Liang et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023) tend to oversimplify the complexities. They struggle to achieve
effective, coherent, and accurate problem-solving processes, particularly when there is a need for
meaningful collaborative interaction (Chen et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023; Zhou
et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023).

Through extensive collaborative practice, humans have developed widely accepted Standardized
Operating Procedures (SOPs) across various domains (Belbin, 2012; Manifesto, 2001; DeMarco &
Lister, 2013). These SOPs play a critical role in supporting task decomposition and effective coor-
dination. Furthermore, SOPs outline the responsibilities of each team member, while establishing
standards for intermediate outputs. Well-defined SOPs improve the consistent and accurate exe-
cution of tasks that align with defined roles and quality standards (Belbin, 2012; Manifesto, 2001;
DeMarco & Lister, 2013; Wooldridge & Jennings, 1998). For instance, in a software company,
Product Managers analyze competition and user needs to create Product Requirements Documents
(PRDs) using a standardized structure, to guide the developmental process.

Inspired by such ideas, we design a promising GPT-based Meta-Programming framework called
MetaGPT that significantly benefits from SOPs. Unlike other works (Li et al., 2023; Qian et al.,
2023), MetaGPT requires agents to generate structured outputs, such as high-quality requirements

In software engineering, SOPs promote collaboration among various roles. MetaGPT showcases
its ability to decompose complex tasks into specific actionable procedures assigned to various roles

documents, design artifacts, flowcharts, and interface specifications. The use of intermediate struc-
tured outputs significantly increases the success rate of target code generation. Because it helps
maintain consistency in communication, minimizing ambiguities and errors during collaboration.
More graphically, in a company simulated by MetaGPT, all employees follow a strict and stream-
lined workflow, and all their handovers must comply with certain established standards. This reduces
the risk of hallucinations caused by idle chatter between LLMs, particularly in role-playing frame-
works, like: “Hi, hello and how are you?” – Alice (Product Manager); “Great! Have you had
lunch?” – Bob (Architect).

Benefiting from SOPs, MetaGPT offers a promising approach to meta-programming. In this context,
we adopt meta-programming1 as ”programming to program”, in contrast to the broader fields of meta
learning and ”learning to learn” (Schmidhuber, 1987; 1993a; Hochreiter et al., 2001; Schmidhuber,
2006; Finn et al., 2017).

This notion of meta-programming also encompasses earlier efforts like CodeBERT (Feng et al.,
2020) and recent projects such as CodeLlama (Rozi`ere et al., 2023) and WizardCoder (Luo
et al., 2023). However, MetaGPT stands out as a unique solution that allows for efficient meta-
programming through a well-organized group of specialized agents. Each agent has a specific role
and expertise, following some established standards. This allows for automatic requirement analysis,
system design, code generation, modification, execution, and debugging during runtime, highlight-
ing how agent-based techniques can enhance meta-programming.

To validate the design of MetaGPT, we use publicly available HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021a) and
MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) for evaluations. Notably, in code generation benchmarks, MetaGPT
achieves a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) with 85.9% and 87.7% in Pass@1. When compared to other
popular frameworks for creating complex software projects, such as AutoGPT (Torantulino et al.,
2023), LangChain (Chase, 2022), AgentVerse (Chen et al., 2023), and ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023).
MetaGPT also stands out in handling higher levels of software complexity and offering extensive
functionality. Remarkably, in our experimental evaluations, MetaGPT achieves a 100% task com-
pletion rate, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency (time and token costs) of our design.

We summarize our contributions as follows:

• We introduce MetaGPT, a meta-programming framework for multi-agent collaboration based on
LLMs.
It is highly convenient and flexible, with well-defined functions like role definition and
message sharing, making it a useful platform for developing LLM-based multi-agent systems.

• Our innovative integration of human-like SOPs throughout MetaGPT’s design significantly en-
hances its robustness, reducing unproductive collaboration among LLM-based agents. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel executive feedback mechanism that debugs and executes code during runtime,
significantly elevating code generation quality (e.g., 5.4% absolute improvement on MBPP).

• We achieve state-of-the-art performance on HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021a) and MBPP (Austin
et al., 2021). Extensive results convincingly validate MetaGPT, suggesting that it is a promising
meta-programming framework for developing LLM-based multi-agent systems.

2 RELATED WORK

Automatic Programming The roots of automatic programming reach back deep into the previ-
ous century. In 1969, Waldinger & Lee (1969) introduced “PROW,” a system designed to accept
program specifications written in predicate calculus, generate algorithms, and create LISP imple-
mentations (McCarthy, 1978). Balzer (1985) and Soloway (1986) made efforts to advance auto-
matic programming and identified potential methods to achieve it. Recent approaches use natural
language processing (NLP) techniques (Ni et al., 2023; Skreta et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2020; Li
et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2018; 2021b; Zhang et al., 2023). Automatic programming has grown into
an industry delivering paid functions such as Microsoft Copilot. Lately, LLMs-based agents (Yao
et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023) have advanced automatic programming develop-
ment. Among them, ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) and Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) utilize a chain of
thought prompts (Wei et al., 2022) to generate reasoning trajectories and action plans with LLMs.
Both works demonstrate the effectiveness of the ReAct style loop of reasoning as a design paradigm
for empowering automatic programming. Additionally, ToolFormer (Schick et al., 2023) can learn
how to use external tools through simple APIs. The research most closely aligned with our work
by Li et al. (2023) proposes a straightforward role-play framework for programming that involves
communication between agents playing different roles. Qian et al. (2023) utilizes multiple agents for
software development. Although existing papers (Li et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023) have improved
productivity, they have not fully tapped into effective workflows with structured output formats.
This makes it harder to deal with complex software engineering issues.

LLM-Based Multi-Agent Frameworks Recently, LLM-based autonomous agents have gained
tremendous interest in both industry and academia (Wang et al., 2023b). Many works (Chen et al.,
2024; Wang et al., 2023c; Du et al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023; Akata et al., 2023)
have improved the problem-solving abilities of LLMs by integrating discussions among multiple
agents. Stable-Alignment (Liu et al., 2023) creates instruction datasets by deriving consensus on
value judgments through interactions across a sandbox with LLM agents. Other works focus on
sociological phenomena. For example, Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023) creates a “town” of 25
agents to study language interaction, social understanding, and collective memory. In the Natural
Language-Based Society of Mind (NLSOM) (Zhuge et al., 2023), agents with different functions
interact to solve complex tasks through multiple rounds of “mindstorms.” Cai et al. (2023) propose
a model for cost reduction by combining large models as tool makers and small models as tool users.

Some works emphasize cooperation and competition related to planning and strategy (Bakhtin et al.,
2022); others propose LLM-based economies (Zhuge et al., 2023). These works focus on open-
world human behavior simulation, while MetaGPT aims to introduce human practice into multi-
agents frameworks. Besides, LLM-based agents face the challenges of “assistant repeated instruc-
tion” or “infinite loop of message” (Talebirad & Nadiri, 2023; Li et al., 2023). These challenges
become more urgent in task-oriented collaborations, which require consistent and mutually benefi-
cial interactions (Elazar et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023). This motivates our focus
on applying advanced concepts such as Standard Operating Procedures in software development to
multi-agent frameworks.

They can also subscribe to relevant messages based on their profiles. Right: After generating the
initial code, the Engineer agent runs and checks for errors. If errors occur, the agent checks past
messages stored in memory and compares them with the PRD, system design, and code files.

3 METAGPT: A META-PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORK

MetaGPT is a meta-programming framework for LLM-based multi-agent systems. Sec. 3.1 pro-
vides an explanation of role specialization, workflow and structured communication in this frame-
work, and illustrates how to organize a multi-agent system within the context of SOPs. Sec. 3.2
presents a communication protocol that enhances role communication efficiency. We also imple-
ment structured communication interfaces and an effective publish-subscribe mechanism. These
methods enable agents to obtain directional information from other roles and public information
from the environment. Finally, we introduce executable feedback—a self-correction mechanism for
further enhancing code generation quality during run-time in Sec. 3.3.

3.1 AGENTS IN STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES

Specialization of Roles Unambiguous role specialization enables the breakdown of complex work
into smaller and more specific tasks. Solving complex tasks or problems often requires the collab-
oration of agents with diverse skills and expertise, each contributing specialized outputs tailored to
specific issues.

In a software company, a Product Manager typically conducts business-oriented analysis and derives
insights, while a software engineer is responsible for programming. We define five roles in our
software company: Product Manager, Architect, Project Manager, Engineer, and QA Engineer, as
shown in Figure 1. In MetaGPT, we specify the agent’s profile, which includes their name, profile,
goal, and constraints for each role. We also initialize the specific context and skills for each role.
For instance, a Product Manager can use web search tools, while an Engineer can execute code, as
shown in Figure 2. All agents adhere to the React-style behavior as described in Yao et al. (2022).

Every agent monitors the environment (i.e., the message pool in MetaGPT) to spot important ob-
servations (e.g.,, messages from other agents). These messages can either directly trigger actions or
assist in finishing the job.

Workflow across Agents By defining the agents’ roles and operational skills, we can establish
basic workflows. In our work, we follow SOP in software development, which enables all agents to
work in a sequential manner.

nificant dependence on SOPs. The more detailed demonstration can be found in Appendix B.

Specifically, as shown in Figure 1, upon obtaining user requirements, the Product Manager under-
takes a thorough analysis, formulating a detailed PRD that includes User Stories and Requirement
Pool. This serves as a preliminary functional breakdown. The structured PRD is then passed to
the Architect, who translates the requirements into system design components, such as File Lists,
Data Structures, and Interface Definitions. Once captured in the system design, the information is
directed towards the Project Manager for task distribution. Engineers proceed to execute the des-
ignated classes and functions as outlined (detailed in Figure 2).
In the following stage, the QA
Engineer formulates test cases to enforce stringent code quality. In the final step, MetaGPT pro-
duces a meticulously crafted software solution. We provide a detailed schematic (Figure 3) and a
concrete instance (Appendix B) of the SOP workflow in MetaGPT.

3.2 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

Structured Communication Interfaces Most current LLM-based multi-agent frameworks (Li
et al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023) utilize unconstrained natural
language as a communication interface.

However, despite the versatility of natural language, a question arises: does pure natural language
communication suffice for solving complex tasks? For example, in the telephone game (or Chinese

5

Preprint

whispers)2, after several rounds of communication, the original information may be quite distorted.
Inspired by human social structures, we propose using structured communication to formulate the
communication of agents. We establish a schema and format for each role and request that individ-
uals provide the necessary outputs based on their specific role and context.

As shown in Figure 3, the Architect agent generates two outputs: the system interface design and a
sequence flow diagram. These contain system module design and interaction sequences, which serve
as important deliverables for Engineers. Unlike ChatDev (Zhao et al., 2023), agents in MetaGPT
communicate through documents and diagrams (structured outputs) rather than dialogue. These
documents contain all necessary information, preventing irrelevant or missing content.

Publish-Subscribe Mechanism Sharing information is critical in collaboration. For instance,
Architects and Engineers often need to reference PRDs. However, communicating this information
each time in a one-to-one manner, as indicated by previous work (Li et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023;
Zhang et al., 2023), can complicate the communication topology, resulting in inefficiencies.

To address this challenge, a viable approach is to store information in a global message pool. As
shown in Figure 2 (left), we introduce a shared message pool that allows all agents to exchange
messages directly. These agents not only publish their structured messages in the pool but also access
messages from other entities transparently. Any agent can directly retrieve required information
from the shared pool, eliminating the need to inquire about other agents and await their responses.
This enhances communication efficiency.

Sharing all information with every agent can lead to information overload. During task execution,
an agent typically prefers to receive only task-related information and avoid distractions through
irrelevant details. Effective management and dissemination of this information play a crucial role.
We offer a simple and effective solution-subscription mechanism (in Figure 2 (left)). Instead of
relying on dialogue, agents utilize role-specific interests to extract relevant information. They can

activates its action only after receiving all its prerequisite dependencies. As illustrated in Figure 3,
the Architect mainly focuses on PRDs provided by the Product Manager, while documents from
roles such as the QA Engineer might be of lesser concern.

3.3

ITERATIVE PROGRAMMING WITH EXECUTABLE FEEDBACK

In daily programming tasks, the processes of debugging and optimization play important roles.
However, existing methods often lack a self-correction mechanism, which leads to unsuccessful code
generation. Previous work introduced non-executable code review and self-reflection (Zhao et al.,
2023; Yao et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023). However, they still face challenges in
ensuring code executability and runtime correctness.

Our first MetaGPT implementations overlooked certain errors during the review process, due to
LLM hallucinations (Manakul et al., 2023). To overcome this, after initial code generation, we
introduce an executable feedback mechanism to improve the code iteratively. More specifically, as
shown in Figure 2, the Engineer is asked to write code based on the original product requirements
and design.

This enables the Engineer to continuously improve code using its own historical execution and
debugging memory. To obtain additional information, the Engineer writes and executes the corre-
sponding unit test cases, and subsequently receives the test results. If satisfactory, additional devel-
opment tasks are initiated. Otherwise the Engineer debugs the code before resuming programming.
This iterative testing process continues until the test is passed or a maximum of 3 retries is reached.

4 EXPERIMENTS

4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTING

Datasets We use two public benchmarks, HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021a) and MBPP (Austin
et al., 2021), and a self-generated, more challenging software development benchmark named Soft-

Preprint

wareDev: (1) HumanEval includes 164 handwritten programming tasks. These tasks encompass
function specifications, descriptions, reference codes, and tests. (2) MBPP consists of 427 Python
tasks. These tasks cover core concepts and standard library features and include descriptions, ref-
erence codes, and automated tests. (3) Our SoftwareDev dataset is a collection of 70 representa-
tive examples of software development tasks, each with its own task prompt (see Table 8). These
tasks have diverse scopes (See Figure 5), such as mini-games, image processing algorithms, data
visualization. They offer a robust testbed for authentic development tasks. Contrary to previous
datasets (Chen et al., 2021a; Austin et al., 2021), SoftwareDev focuses on the engineering aspects.
In the comparisons, we randomly select seven representative tasks for evaluation.

Evaluation Metrics For HuamnEval and MBPP, we follow the unbiased version of Pass @k as
presented by (Chen et al., 2021a; Dong et al., 2023), to evaluate the functional accuracy of the top-k

For SoftwareDev, we prioritize practical use and evaluate performance through human evaluations
(A, E) or statistical analysis (B, C, D): (A) Executability: this metric rates code from 1 (failure/non-
functional) to 4 (flawless). ‘1’ is for non-functional, ‘2’ for runnable but imperfect, ‘3’ for nearly
perfect, and ‘4’ for flawless code. (B) Cost: the cost evaluations here include the (1) running time,
(2) token usage, and (3) expenses. (C) Code Statistics: this includes (1) code files, (2) lines of code
per file, and (3) total code lines. (D) Productivity: basically, it is defined as the number of token
usage divided by the number of lines of code, which refers to the consumption of tokens per code
line. (E) Human Revision Cost: refers to times of manual code corrections, which tackle problems
like package import errors, incorrect class names, or incomplete reference paths. Typically, each
correction involves up to 3 lines of code.

Baselines We compare our method with recent domain-specific LLMs in the code generation field,
including AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022), Incoder (Fried et al., 2022), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023),
CodeGen (Nijkamp et al., 2023), CodeX (Chen et al., 2021a), and CodeT (Chen et al., 2022) and
general domain LLMs such as PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). Several
results of baselines (such as Incoder, CodeGeeX) are provided by Dong et al. (2023). In HumanEval
and MBPP, we slightly modified the prompts to align with response format requirements. These
modifications aim to address format-specific issues (i.e., Python problems). With the SoftwareDev
benchmark, we provide a comprehensive comparison between MetaGPT, AutoGPT (Torantulino
et al., 2023), LangChain (Chase, 2022) with Python Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) tool3, Agent-
Verse (Chen et al., 2023), and ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023).

in these two public benchmarks. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, MetaGPT outperforms ChatDev on
the challenging SoftwareDev dataset in nearly all metrics. For example, considering the executabil-
ity, MetaGPT achieves a score of 3.75, which is very close to 4 (flawless). Besides, it takes less time
(503 seconds), clearly less than ChatDev. Considering the code statistic and the cost of human revi-
sion, it also significantly outperforms ChatDev. Although MetaGPT requires more tokens (24,613
or 31,255 compared to 19,292), it needs only 126.5/124.3 tokens to generate one line of code. In
contrast, ChatDev uses 248.9 tokens. These results highlight the benefits of SOPs in collabora-
tions between multiple agents. Additionally, we demonstrate the autonomous software generation
capabilities of MetaGPT through visualization samples (Figure 5). For additional experiments and
analysis, please refer to Appendix C.

Compared to open-source baseline methods such as AutoGPT and autonomous agents such as
AgentVerse and ChatDev, MetaGPT offers functions for software engineering tasks. As presented
in Table 2, our framework encompasses a wide range of abilities to handle complex and specialized
development tasks efficiently. Incorporating SOPs (e.g., role-play expertise, structured communi-
cation, streamlined workflow) can significantly improve code generation. Other baseline methods

can easily integrate SOP-like designs to improve their performance, similar to injecting chain-of-
thought (Wei et al., 2022) in LLMs.

4.4 ABLATION STUDY

The Effectiveness of Roles To understand the impact of different roles on the final results, we
perform two tasks that involve generating effective code and calculating average statistics. When we
exclude certain roles, unworkable codes are generated. As indicated by Table 3, the addition of roles
different from just the Engineer consistently improves both revisions and executability. While more
roles slightly increase the expenses, the overall performance improves noticeably, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the various roles.

The Effectiveness of Executable Feedback Mechanism As shown in Figure 4, adding executable
feedback into MetaGPT leads to a significant improvement of 4.2% and 5.4% in Pass @1 on Hu-
manEval and MBPP, respectively. Besides, Table 1 shows that the feedback mechanism improves
feasibility (3.67 to 3.75) and reduces the cost of human revisions (2.25 to 0.83). These results
illustrate how our designed feedback mechanism can produce higher-quality code. Additional quan-
titative results of MetaGPT and MetaGPT without executable feedback are shown in Table 4 and
Table 9.

5 CONCLUSION

This work introduces MetaGPT, a novel meta-programming framework that leverages SOPs to en-
hance the problem-solving capabilities of multi-agent systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs). MetaGPT models a group of agents as a simulated software company, analogous to simu-
lated towns (Park et al., 2023) and the Minecraft Sandbox in Voyager (Wang et al., 2023a). MetaGPT
leverages role specialization, workflow management, and efficient sharing mechanisms such as mes-
sage pools and subscriptions, rendering it a flexible and portable platform for autonomous agents
and multi-agent frameworks. It uses an executable feedback mechanism to enhance code generation
quality during runtime. In extensive experiments, MetaGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks. The successful integration of human-like SOPs inspires future research
on human-inspired techniques for artificial multi-agent systems. We also view our work as an early
attempt to regulate LLM-based multi-agent frameworks. See also the outlook (Appendix A).

A OUTLOOK

A.1 SELF-IMPROVEMENT MECHANISMS

One limitation of the MetaGPT version in the main text of this paper is that each software project is
executed independently. However, through active teamwork, a software development team should
learn from the experience gained by developing each project, thus becoming more compatible and
successful over time.

This is somewhat related to the idea of recursive self-improvement, first informally proposed in
1965 (Good, 1965), with first concrete implementations since 1987 (Schmidhuber, 1987; 1993b;
Schmidhuber et al., 1998), culminating in the concept of mathematically optimal self-referential
self-improvers (Schmidhuber, 2003; 2009). Generally speaking, a system should learn from experi-
ence in the real world, and meta-learn better learning algorithms from experiences of learning, and
meta-meta-learn better meta-learning algorithms from experiences of meta-learning, etc., without
any limitations except those of computability and physics.

More recent, somewhat related work leverages the reasoning ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and recursively improves prompts of LLMs, to improve performance on certain downstream
tasks (Fernando et al., 2023; Zelikman et al., 2023), analogous to the adaptive prompt engineer of
2015 (Schmidhuber, 2015) where one neural network learns to generate sequence of queries or
prompts for another pre-trained neural network whose answers may help the first network to learn
new tasks more quickly.

In our present work, we also explore a self-referential mechanism that recursively modifies the con-
straint prompts of agents based on information they observe during software development. Our
initial implementation works as follows. Prior to each project, every agent in the software company
reviews previous feedback and makes necessary adjustments to their constraint prompts. This en-
ables them to continuously learn from past project experiences and enhance the overall multi-agent
system by improving each individual in the company. We first establish a handover feedback action
for each agent. This action is responsible for critically summarizing the information received dur-
ing the development of previous projects and integrating this information in an updated constraint
prompt. The summarized information is stored in long-term memory such that it can be inherited
by future constraint prompt updates. When initiating a new project, each agent starts with a react
action. Each agent evaluates the received feedback and summarizes how they can improve in a
constraint prompt.

One current limitation is that these summary-based optimizations only modify constraints in the
specialization of roles (Sec. 3.1) rather than structured communication interfaces in communication
protocols (Sec. 3.2). Future advancements are yet to be explored.

A.2 MULTI-AGENT ECONOMIES

In real-world teamwork, the interaction processes are often not hardcoded. For example, in a soft-
ware company, the collaboration SOP may change dynamically.

One implementation of such self-organization is discussed in the paper on a “Natural Language-
Based Society of Mind” (NLSOM) (Zhuge et al., 2023), which introduced the idea of an “Economy
of Minds” (EOM), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for societies of LLMs and other
agents. Instead of using standard RL techniques to optimize the total reward of the system through
modifications of neural network parameters, EOMs use the principles of supply and demand in free
markets to assign credit (money) to those agents that contribute to economic success (reward).

The recent agent-based platform of DeepWisdom (AgentStore4) is compatible with the credit as-
signment concept of EOMs. Each agent in AgentStore provides a list of services with corresponding
costs. A convenient API is provided so that human users or agents in the platform can easily pur-
chase services from other agents to accomplish their services. Figure 6 displays the User Interface
(UI) of AgentStore, where various agents with different skills are showcased. Besides, individual
developers can participate in building new agents and enable collaborative development within the
community. Specifically, AgentStore allows users to subscribe to agents according to their demands

and pay according to their usage. Moreover, users can purchase additional capabilities to expand the
plug-and-play functions of their existing agents. This allows users to gradually upgrade their agents.
Within the MetaGPT framework, AgentStore can support the collaboration of various agents. Users
can collect several agents together to carry out more complex tasks or projects, and all the agents
share and comply with development and communication protocols defined in MetaGPT.

Figure 6: AgentStore is a platform dedicated to serving users in the creation and development of
agents within the MetaGPT framework. This platform provides users with an operational interface,
allowing users to easily manage a variety of agents with different emotions, personalities, and capa-
bilities for specific tasks.

B A DEMO OF THE EXECUTION

In this section, we outline the complete process of software development using MetaGPT. It begins
with a user’s input command (as shown in Appendix B.1) and ends with software designed according
to the user’s specifications.

B.1 USER INPUT

Upon receiving an instruction from the user, MetaGPT collaborates with a professional development
team to fulfill the task. Here is a demo of user input:

User input

1 write a python3 GUI app such that you can draw an image with it

B.2 METAGPT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

Now we provide a step-by-step explanation of the standardized output process for each agent.

Product Manager The Product Manager generates a Product Requirement Document (PRD), as
detailed in the specified documentation. This document encompasses goals, user stories, competitive
analysis, requirement analysis and requirement pool. Additionally, a competitive quadrant chart is
produced (see Figure 7). Subsequently, these documents and charts are handed over to the architect
for system design.

Architect Based on the requirements in PRD, the Architect agent devises technical specifications
including system architecture diagrams and interface definitions. Initially, the Architect defines the
overarching technical trajectory. Subsequently, the project’s architecture, including files, classes
(Figure 8) and the sequence flow chart (Figure 12), is designed. The Architect’s documentation is
then given to the project manager for task allocation and execution.

System design

1 ## Implementation approach
2 We will use Python’s Tkinter library to create the GUI for the color meter. Tkinter is a standard
(cid:44)→ Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit and is included with most Python installations. It
(cid:44)→ is simple to use and powerful enough for our needs.

3
4 The color selection functionality will be implemented using the PIL (Pillow) library, which allows
(cid:44)→ us to capture the screen’s pixel data. By moving the mouse, we can get the RGB values of
(cid:44)→ the pixel under the mouse cursor in real-time.

5
6 The RGB values will be displayed on the GUI using Tkinter’s Label widget. We will use Python’s

(cid:44)→ threading library to update the RGB values in real-time as the color meter moves.

7
8 The application will be tested for accuracy and performance using Python’s unittest library.

C EXPERIMENTS

C.1 DETAILS OF THE SOFTWAREDEV DATASET

The SoftwareDev dataset includes 70 diverse software development tasks. Table 8 displays the
names and detailed prompts of 11 tasks within the dataset. Note that the first seven tasks listed are
used in the main experiments of this paper.

C.2 ADDITIONAL RESULTS

Quantitative results of MetaGPT As shown in Table 4, MetaGPT achieves an average score
of 3.9, surpassing ChatDev’s score of 2.1 Zhao et al. (2023), which is based on the Chat chain.
Compare the scores of general intelligent algorithms, including AutoGPT Torantulino et al. (2023),
which all score 1.0, failing to generate executable code. We observe that the generated code is often
short, lacks comprehensive logic, and tends to fail to handle cross-file dependencies correctly.

While models such as AutoGPT (Torantulino et al., 2023), Langchain (Chase, 2022), and Agent-
Verse (Chen et al., 2023) display robust general problem-solving capabilities, they lack an essential
element for developing complex systems: systematically deconstructing requirements. Conversely,
MetaGPT simplifies the process of transforming abstract requirements into detailed class and func-
tion designs through a specialized division of labor and SOPs workflow. When compared to Chat-
Dev (Zhao et al., 2023), MetaGPT’s structured messaging and feedback mechanisms not only reduce
loss of communication information but also improve the execution of code.

Quantitative results of MetaGPT w/o executable feedback Table 9 presents the performance of
MetaGPT with GPT-4 32K on 11 tasks within the SoftwareDev dataset. It also shows the average
performance across all 70 tasks (in the last line). Note that the version of MetaGPT used here is the
basic version without the executable feedback mechanism.

Quantitative results of MetaGPT with different LLMs To verify the performance of MetaGPT
on different LLMs, we randomly selected 5 SoftwareDev tasks and conducted experiments using
GPT-3.5 and Deepseek Coder 33B5 as backends. As shown in Table 5, the results indicate that
although MetaGPT can complete tasks with these LLMs, using GPT-4 as the backend yields superior
performance.

Impact of Instruction Levels (High-level v.s. Detailed Instructions) Does the variation in the
level of initial input from humans significantly influence performance outcomes? For examples:

1. High-level prompt: Create a brick breaker game.

2. Detailed prompt: Creating a brick breaker game.

In a brick breaker game, the player
typically controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball towards a wall of
bricks. The goal is to break all the bricks by hitting them with the ball.

Additional experiments were conducted to investigate this aspect: we selected 5 tasks from Soft-
wareDev, and constructed detailed prompts for them. Here are the experimental results:

Table 6: Impact of Instruction Levels. The executability is scored on a grading system ranging
from ‘1’ to ‘4’. A score of ‘1’ signifies complete failure, ‘2’ denotes runnable code, ‘3’ represents
largely expected workflow, and ‘4’ indicates a perfect match to expectations.

We observe that: detailed prompts lead to better software projects with lower productivity ratios
because of clearer requirements and functions, while simple inputs can still generate good enough
software using MetaGPT with an executability rating of 3.8, which is comparable to the detailed
prompt scenario. (Note that, Productivity = Token usage / Total Code Lines. The lower this ratio,
the better.)

The performance of GPT variants in HumanEval benchmark We use the GPT-4’s 67% Hu-
manEval score (OpenAI, 2023) as our baseline, acknowledging its acceptance in the HumanEval
benchmark. We further extend to experiments(five times) with GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613) and GPT-3.5-
Turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613) under various conditions to assess performance. (A) We directly called
the OpenAI API with the prompt in HumanEval. (B) We called the OpenAI API and parsed the
code with regex in the response. (C) We added an additional system prompt, then called the OpenAI
API. The prompt is ”You are an AI that only responds with Python code, NOT ENGLISH. You will

24

Preprint

be given a function signature and its docstring by the user. Write your full implementation (restate
the function signature).” As shown in Table 7, GPT-4 is more sensitive to prompt, code parser, and
post-processing results on the HumanEval data set. It is difficult for GPT-3.5-Turbo to return the
correct completion code without prompt words.

Qualitative results Figure 11 and Figure 12 illustrate the outcomes of the Architect agent’s ef-
forts to design a complex recommender system. These figures showcase the comprehensive system
interface design and program call flow. The latter is essential for creating a sophisticated automated
system. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of this division of labor in developing an automated
software framework.

D LIMITATION AND ETHICS CONCERNS

D.1 LIMITATION

System side At present, our system cannot fully cater to specific scenarios, such as UI and front-
end, as we have yet to incorporate such agents and multimodal tools. Furthermore, despite gen-
erating the most amount of code among comparable frameworks, it remains challenging to fulfill
real-world applications’ diverse and complex requirements.

Human user side A key challenge for users is to interrupt the running process of each agent, or
set the starting running point (checkpoint) for each agent.

D.2 ETHICS CONCERNS

Unemployment and Skill Obsolescence MetaGPT enables more people to program in natural
languages, thereby making it easier for engineers to get started. Over the years, programming
languages have evolved from punched cards to assembly, C, Java, Python, and now natural lan-
guage. As a result, humans have become more proficient at programming, increasing the demand
for programming-related positions. Furthermore, programming with natural language may offer a
significantly easier learning curve, making programming more accessible to a broader audience.

Transparency and Accountability MetaGPT is an open-source framework that facilitates inter-
active communication between multiple agents through natural language. Humans can initiate, ob-
serve, and stop running with the highest level of control. It provides real-time interpretation and op-
eration of the natural language, displayed on the screen and logs, ensuring transparency. MetaGPT
enhances “natural language programming” capabilities, and human engineers are the users and re-
sponsible for the outcomes.

Privacy and Data Security MetaGPT operates locally, ensuring user data privacy and security. It
does not collect user data. For interactions with third-party LLMs, such as those by OpenAI, users
are encouraged to refer to the respective privacy policies (e.g., OpenAI Privacy Policy). However,
we provide the option of open-source LLMs as backends.

E MORE DISCUSSIONS

E.1 DEEP-SEATED CHALLENGES

MetaGPT also alleviates or solves these challenges with its unique designs:

Use Context Efficiently Two sub-challenges are present. First, unfolding short natural language
descriptions accurately to eliminate ambiguity. Second, maintaining information validity in lengthy
contexts, enables LLMs to concentrate on relevant data without distraction.

Reduce Hallucinations Using LLMs to generate entire software programs faces code halluci-
nation problems—-including incomplete implementation of functions, missing dependencies, and
potential undiscovered bugs, which may be more serious. LLMs often struggle with software gen-
eration due to vague task definitions. Focusing on granular tasks like requirement analysis and
package selection offers guided thinking, which LLMs lack in broad task solving.

E.2

INFORMATION OVERLOAD

In MetaGPT, we use a global message pool and a subscription mechanism to address “information
overload,” which refers to the problem of receiving excessive or irrelevant information. This issue
is dependent on specific applications. MetaGPT employs a message pool to streamline communi-
cation, ensuring efficiency. Additionally, a subscription mechanism filters out irrelevant contexts,
enhancing the relevance and utility of the information. This design is particularly crucial in soft-

essential.

Write p5.js code for Flappy Bird where you control a yellow bird continu-
ously flying between a series of green pipes. The bird flaps every time you
left click the mouse. If it falls to the ground or hits a pipe, you lose. This
game goes on indefinitely until you lose; you get points the further you go.
Create a tank battle game.
Write an excel data processing program based on streamlit and pandas. The
screen first shows an excel file upload button. After the excel file is uploaded,
use pandas to display its data content. The program is required to be concise,
easy to maintain, and not over-designed. It uses streamlit to process web
screen displays, and pandas is sufficient to process excel reading and display.
Please make sure others can execute directly without introducing additional
packages.
Write a management program based on the crud addition, deletion, modifi-
cation and query processing of the customer business entity. The customer
needs to save this information: name, birthday, age, sex, and phone. The data
is stored in client.db, and there is a judgement whether the customer table ex-
ists. If it doesn’t, it needs to be created first. Querying is done by name; same
for deleting. The program is required to be concise, easy to maintain, and not
over-designed. The screen is realized through streamlit and sqlite—no need
to introduce other additional packages.
